  What is Metaflask?

    Metaflask is the informal "Flask Software Foundation".  It's the
    closest equivalent to stewardship that Flask has and currently
    starting up.

  What does it do?

    The Metaflask project's aim is to ensure that the Flask ecosystem
    does nots suffer from abondoned extensions or problems in Flask
    itself.  As a purely virtual organization without legal power it
    does not do anything fancy other than acting as a central space
    where discussions about Flask can be held in a structured way.

  How is it structured?

    The Metaflask project is a meritocracy with each project maintained
    through the Metaflask project being a dictatorship.  As such the
    Metaflask project does not really have a clear form of governance.
    It is whatever the members of the project decide it is.

  Who are the members?

    For the current members have a look at the MEMBERS file in the
    same repository.

  How do I become a member?

    The way to become a member is to open an issue on this repository
    with the request to join it.  Currently you have to fulfil one of
    the following criteria:

      * be a Flask developer
      * be a Flask extension maintainer
      * be a future Flask extension maintainer

    If you are accepted as member or not is arbitrary and the decision
    is made in an even more arbitrary process by the members of
    Metaflask.  Rejections can be challenged by flamewars on the closed
    issue.

  What privileges do members have?

    Members do not have any implied privileges as such.

  Why would I want to become a member?

    Lower the bus factor of Flask and the ecosystem and of course to
    gain fame.
