Metaflask Members

  This folder contains the list of all members of the Metaflask
  project.  Here is how the maintenance of this list works:

  -- The Format

     Each member is in a separate file.  The format is `<number>_<id>.txt`
     where number is increasing with each member added.  Numbers are
     never reused.  The id is the github username.

     If a member becomes inactive the extension is changed to
     `.inactive.txt`.

     The content of the file is a mime header (Key + colon + value)
     similarly to email to HTTP.  Then an optional body with some
     text in plain text format separated by a newline.

  -- Pull Requests

     If you want to join send a pull request.  Do not add a number,
     whoever merges it adds it.

  -- Giving Access to Github

     Currently the access to the github repo is manually managed.  Someone
     will have to write a bot for this.

  -- Who is allowed to give access?

     Any member can add more members.  The only rule for adding members is
     that you are only allowed to add members that you fully trust.  Do
     not add people just because you like them :)

  -- Who is allowed to remove members?

     Only member 0001.  And yes, changing your own number is not going to
     do the trick.  Later there will be some sort of voting system but
     totally not interested in this right now.
