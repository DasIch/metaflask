PROJECT OVERVIEW

  So how does this work?  Any Metaflask member is free to manage his or
  her projects here or correct information about other projects.  They
  can also add other people's projects for consistency.

  For instance flask extensions can be documented here as well.

  The projects/ folder here acts as a central register of projects that
  we know exists.  Most of the format is freeform with the exception of
  the following:

    README/README.md/README.rst
      this needs to exist in the project to explain it a little bit.

    META
      A file with mime information with the most important details about
      the project.  The following keys are currently known (and most keys
      can appear multiple times for multiple values):

        Name: the name of the project
        Website: the URL to the website of the project
        Github: the location of the repository on github
        Bitbucket: the location of the repository on bitbucket
        PyPI: the name of the package on PyPI if it exists
        License: the short license code.
        Status: the status of the project.  "active" / "inactive" /
                "unknown"

    PROJECT_LEAD
      A file with mime information about the author.  Same format as for
      the members on the toplevel.  If the lead of the project is indeed
      a member of the Metaflask team then this should be a symlink
      instead.

    stewardship
      If there are Metaflask members that either own the project or want
      to act as stewards for the project they should symlink themselves
      into it.  All projects listed on Metaflask need at least one
      steward.

      For responsibilities see the toplevel README.
